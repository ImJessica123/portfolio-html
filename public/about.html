<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I was born and raised in Los Angeles, California and continue to live in the 
  area to this day. I'm a marketing professional with over 20 years of experience
helping companies create connections with their customers that translate into higher
average check and more frequent visits. </p>

<p>My hobbies include reading, hiking, traveling, working on home improvement projects 
  and spending time with my family. My favorite book is The Poisonwood Bible, favorite 
  vacation I've taken has been Cancun and my favorite home improvement project has been
resurfacing our kitchen cabinets. </p>

<p>I currently live in West Hills with my husband and my very cute bichon frise, Marty and Maltipoo, Scruffy. 
Marty is an incredibly stubborn, highly loveable and completely adorable 4 year old. Scruffy is the 11 years
old and is the sweetest dog imagineable, he lives for tummy rubs and cuddles.
